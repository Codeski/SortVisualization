## Features

To write your own sorting algorithm download the source, create a class that extends Sort and override the run method. Then add it to the sort JMenu and actionPerformed method in the Window class.

In future versions it will be even easier to write and test your own sorting algorithms.

## Dependencies

Any operating system (tested on Windows and OS X) that has Java 7+ installed.
